# Hi!
### I see you have discovered Jonty, a discord bot that i develop in my free time :D
If you want to get this bot running on your machine, then you'll need to do a few things.
1. Ensure you have [Python 3.11](https://www.python.org/downloads/) or above installed on your system. (Python 3.12 is required for multi-threaded logging.)
2. Install the contents of requirements.txt with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Create a Bot at https://discord.com/developers.
4. Fill in the `.env.template` file and rename it to `.env`.
5. Jonty should now be able to run!
